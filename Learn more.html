Samulnori has its roots in pungmul, a Korean folk genre
comprising music, acrobatics, folk dance, and rituals, which
was traditionally performed in rice farming villages in order to
ensure and to celebrate good harvests.

Until modern times, the majority of South Korean society was
based in agriculture. Farmers worked in collectives, working
together to improve their chances for a successful harvest.
Often, each village had their own “farmer’s band” that would
not only play on these special ritual occasions to pray to the
heavens for good weather or an abundant harvest, but also
simply to encourage the farmers as they worked.
<pre>
<h3>Their music of pungmul, also often
called nongak, literally, “farming
music,” is the origin of samulnori.</h3>
