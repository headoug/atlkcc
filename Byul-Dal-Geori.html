For example, a most famous garak (melodic sequence) titled “Byul-Dal-Geori” 별달거리
(roughly, “A Song to the Stars and Moon”) from Youngnam feature a part where all four
players stop their playing and sing/chant in unison. The dynamic, powerful chant is
a cry out to the heavens in thanks for a good harvest and a wish for another good year.

하늘 보고 별을 따고 땅을 보고 농사 짓고
올해도 대풍이요 내년에도 풍년일세
달아달아 밝은 달아 대낮같이 밝은 달아
어둠속의 불빛이 우리네를 비춰주네

We look up to the sky to gather the stars and look to the ground to farm,
This year was an abundant harvest, next year will be a rich year,
(Oh) moon, moon, brightest moon, a moon as bright as day,
Shines on all of us in the dark of night
